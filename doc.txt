Mutagion - a pyweek 13 entry
By - saluk
Background - a new megavirus is about to ravage the USA
Objective - save as much of the population as possible

Controls - Click on cities to see info about them.
The city panel will list people who are reporting symptoms,
as well as showing a list of actions to take in the city.

Find who really has the virus and not just a common cold,
and fight back! Use advertising to gain influence and shut
down well connected cities, hire researchers to discover
cures for the virus, as it will keep mutating, and hire
doctors to administer the cures.

When the virus has either killed its food supply, or been
wiped out, you will be presented with a score.

How much of the population can you save?
